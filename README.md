FiberJ aims to provide a unified, open source platform for scientific computing in x-ray fiber diffraction, both non-crystalline and poly-crystalline.

Current work focuses on implementing FiberNet pattern processing and simulation methods for non-crystalline fibers, in particular, the core functions of WCEN and RADFN:  

1. Pattern visualization;
2. Image processing;
3. Diffraction parameter determination;
4. Data correction;
5. Data transformation into reciprocal space;
6. Data plotting and analysis;
7. Angular deconvolution.

Future work:

8. A scripting language for batch and command line processing;
9. API for writing plugins and extensions;
10. Diffraction simulation;
11. Core FibreFix functions.
