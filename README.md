FiberJ aims to provide a unified, open source platform for scientific computing in x-ray fiber diffraction, both non-crystalline and poly-crystalline.

Current work focuses on implementing FiberNet pattern processing and simulation methods for non-crystalline fibers, in particular, the core functions of WCEN and RADFN:  

1. Pattern visualization
2. Image processing
3. Diffraction parameter determination
4. Data correction
5. Data transformation into reciprocal space
6. Data plotting and analysis
7. Angular deconvolution
8. Patten segmentation

Future work:

9. Diffraction simulation
a. Core FibreFix functions
b. A scripting language for batch and command line processing
c. API for writing plugins and extensions
